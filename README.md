# HapticSommerSchool

The main gloa of this project is to create a easy to bulid and assamble haptic instalation which can be controlled as a haptic devise. This is made possible by the use of a joit with integrated springs. A greater displacment of the motor for a smaller amount of force compeared to a rigid robotic arm are therfor possible. 

In Haptic devices there are two main ways for control. Impedance control aim to steer the position by reading the motor force. Admittance control aim to control the force of the device by adjusting the position. This two are integrated as methods and can be used directly, By the use of the low level libaries this contol codes may also be created by the user. A discriptive block diagram of the two control loops.

## Code
The code which is to be used can be found in Code.

The main control .ino file can be altered to control the arm in different available modes. The libaries can also be used seperately for control of other mechanical instalation. 

The main goL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE 

## CAD
A version off the design can be found in CAD, this may not be the final version
